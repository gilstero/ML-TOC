Instructions for executing an experiment with availible code:

1. Please navigate to the home directory (experiment/) where you will see the following files:
- checkflips.py
- nonnegativemarginals.py
- runexperiments.py
- strictlydecreasing.py
- strictlyincreasing.py
- toyexamplegraph.py
- instructions.txt
rq/
    - CSVtoNPY.py
    - rq1.py
    - rq1andrq2solutions.py
    - timing.py

2. A brief overview of every files' usecase is highlighted in the top of every file.

3. To execute your own experiment please begin by downloading all needed files and utilities.

4. First, execute createdatasets.py to create both the nonnegative datasets and the strictly increasing datasets.

5. Second, nagivate to the rq/ directory to the file rq1.py. rq1.py runs the policies to create rankings for both the nonnegative 
and strictly increasing datasets. More information on how to run the file is included in comments inside of rq1.py

6. Finally run rq1andrq2solutions.py to get terminal prinouts of % win rate of PAG-F, ML-AUTOC values, and TOC curves.

Package versions:
These experiments were executed on python 3.9.7 - the following packages are needed:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- re
- pathlib
- os
- tqdm
- sys
- itertools

Extra:
- toyexamplegraph.py can be ran to re-create the graph that was shown in the paper (figure 1)
- checkflips.py is a test for seeing how many flips occur in a PAG-F ranking of a dataset
